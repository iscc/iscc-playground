# What is the ISCC

The ISCC is a similarity preserving fingerprint and identifier for digital media assets.

ISCCs are generated algorithmically from digital content, just like cryptographic hashes. However, instead of using a single cryptographic hash function to identify data only, the ISCC uses various algorithms to create a composite identifier that exhibits similarity-preserving properties (soft hash).

The component-based structure of the ISCC identifies content at multiple levels of abstraction. Each component is self-describing, modular, and can be used separately or with others to aid in various content identification tasks. The algorithmic design supports content deduplication, database synchronization, indexing, integrity verification, timestamping, versioning, data provenance, similarity clustering, anomaly detection, usage tracking, allocation of royalties, fact-checking and general digital asset management use-cases.
